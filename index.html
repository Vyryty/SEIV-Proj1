        <h1>What is Computer Science?</h1>
        <p>
            According to the encyclopedia Britannica, Computer Science is defined as "The study of computers   
            and computing as well as their theoretical and practical applications. Computer science applies  
            the principles of mathematics, engineering, and logic to a plethora of functions, including 
            algorithm formulation, software and hardware development, and artificial intelligence.

            Computer Science helps users solve problems faster and more accurately than solving problems by hand. 
            Computer Science solutions include modeling simulations that allow engineers to test against far more 
            potential situations than they could with only physical tests. Solutions also include advanced 3D 
            modeling software which helps animators and artists create intricate worlds with realistic material 
            physics. Computer Science provides advancement in technological development with the progress of 
            Artificial Intelligence.
