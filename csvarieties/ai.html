        <h1>What is Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence?</h1>
        <p>
            Computer science with artificial intelligence is about as straightforward as it sounds: it's
            computer science that is largely focused on creating, implementing, and/or tweaking artificial
            intelligence. In several ways, going with this focus may bring you slightly more in-tune with 
            the field of data science. This is because a large part of creating
            a good model is to be able to understand and "explain" the data to the AI in a way that it can
            understand. But what does that mean? And what is artificial intelligence?
        </p>
        
        <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
        <p>
            Artificial intelligence can sound a bit overwhelming at first, but it doesn't have to be very
            complicated. Artificial intelligence really just refers to some algorithm (or "model") which
            is able to solve a problem. Technically, that makes any old algorithm artificial intelligence.
            What this usually refers to, though, is an algorithm which is able to solve a complex problem
            which usually can't just be computed normally. This could be something like identifying cats
            in images, playing chess, or finding a path through a maze. While some of these problems could
            potentially be programmed into an algorithm, it wouldn't be very practical!
        </p>

        <h2>What Would I Do?</h2>
        <p>
            In order to make artificial intelligence, it takes some intelligence! You need to be able to:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Analyze a situation and create data from it (if data is not present)</li>
            <li>Convert data into a more readable or computable format</li>
            <li>Write an algorithm which acts on data that you have given to it</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            When it comes to analyzing a situation, it usually just boils down to "how can I make this
            something that a computer can tinker with?" Once you've done that, this will set you up for
            giving that data to your algorithm. If you already have data, make sure you can interpret it
            so that you can tell when your algorithm is not doing what it's supposed to do. Once all of
            that is taken care of, now you just need to write the algorithm!
        </p>
        <p>
            Just to make sure that it's been said, you may not always make models yourself. Depending on
            your focus, you may be in charge of interpreting or converting data, debugging the algorithm,
            or collecting more data to be tested. Whatever the case, artificial intelligence is advancing
            quickly, so it's okay if it's a lot to take in. Just take it step by step and you'll be set
            and out in the world of AI in no time!
