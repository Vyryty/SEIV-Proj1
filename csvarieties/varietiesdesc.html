        <h1>Which Flavor of Computer Science?</h1>
        <p>
            You may have guessed, but computer science is actually a rather vague term.
            Computer science for the most part refers to just about any job that utilizes
            code to perform important functions on one or more computers. This can apply
            to several different jobs, anywhere from hundreds to even thousands of jobs,
            which may fall under computer science, but can be completely different in many
            ways. With this in mind, it can be very important to get an idea of what you
            want from your career in computer science, which can narrow down which field
            you'd like to go into.

        <h2>Computer Science as a Career</h2>
        <p>
            If your specialty is just computer science as a whole, your options for careers
            will most likely be very flexible, ranging from web development to software
            engineering. If you don't have any particular focus with code, regular
            computer science can be a good route to take to find good jobs without
            limiting your options too much.
