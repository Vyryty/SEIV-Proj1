        <h1>Which Flavor of Computer Science?</h1>
        <p>
            You may have guessed, but computer science is actually a rather vague term.
            Computer science for the most part refers to just about any job that utilizes
            code to perform important functions on one or more computers. This can apply
            to several different jobs, anywhere from hundreds to even thousands of jobs,
            which may fall under computer science, but can be completely different in many
            ways. With this in mind, it can be very important to get an idea of what you
            want from your career in computer science, which can narrow down which field
            you'd like to go into. This page gives you some information to go on to gauge
            your interests, but if you'd like more information, click the link below!

        <h2>Computer Science as a Career</h2>
        <p>
            If your specialty is just computer science as a whole, your options for careers
            will most likely be very flexible, ranging from web development to software
            engineering. If you don't have any particular focus with code, regular
            computer science can be a good route to take to find good jobs without
            limiting your options too much.

        <h2>Computer Science with Gaming</h2>
        <p>
            Do you enjoy playing video games? Perhaps you'd like to make your own? Some people
            may think that video games are mostly an "art people" thing, but that's not really
            true! While artists are important for immersing an audience into a game, it's the
            programmers who actually make the mechanics and a large part of the functionality.
            Designing video games has a lot to do with programming and pseudo-science, since
            it's useful to know a thing or two to know how objects should interact with the
            world they exist in. If you wish you could create things in the real world with
            your coding skills, video games might just be what you're looking for!

        <h2>Computer Science with Cyber Security</h2>
        <p>
            Whether it be a website, an application, video games, or just about anything else
            that has to do with a computer, everything needs protection. Computers are very
            volatile by design, which also means that some people can abuse that to steal
            information or damage computers. That's where cyber security comes in! There are
            several different kinds of cyber security jobs you could get, each with its own
            focus, but many of them have to do with defense against hackers. If you like
            puzzles or to find bugs in code, cyber security might be a good fit for you!

        <h2>Computer Science with Business</h2>
        <p>
            While "computer science with business" may sound bland, it's a very broad and
            important distinction to make! Considering that computers are relatively new
            in human history, plenty of businesses are still working on digitizing and many
            people in those businesses are still trying to adapt to the evolving world of
            computers. A large part of this field would most likely be you using your
            computer expertise to help perform necessary company tasks, which could range
            from accounting to full-on software development! If you're not sure what
            specific way you'd like to apply your computer knowledge, but know that you want
            to be in a very professional environment, this may be the route for you!

        <h2>Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <p>
            In more recent years, artificial intelligence has become a hot commodity as
            computers are learning how to do increasingly more difficult tasks on their own.
            Though that is true, there is a lot of help behind the scenes for an AI to be
            able to do those things! In fact, there is enough specialized help that some
            companies just need help putting some together. The nice thing is that studying
            in artificial intelligence gives you a new skill that you could use just about
            anywhere, even if you don't understand the most advanced AI.

        <h2>Data Science</h2>
        <p>
            One of the nice things about computers is that they live up to their name. They
            are really good at computing things, especially when those things are numbers!
            This is where data science comes into the picture as an important variant of
            computer science specialty. On the internet, companies who run websites can
            make money by gathering and selling data about their users which third parties
            can use to advertize products to them. That being said, they need a way to
            process, interpret, and understand the data that they collect, which is the
            primary job of a data scientist. If you enjoy transforming data into a
            human-readable format, data science may be right up your alley!
