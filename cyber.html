            <h1>What is Cyber Security?</h1>
            <p>A computer science degree with an emphasis in cybersecurity 
                will provide broader computer education, covering everything 
                from statistics and boolean logic to programming and web 
                development. Cybersecurity, on the other hand, will provide 
                the most security-centric education available.
