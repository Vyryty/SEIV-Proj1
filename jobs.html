				A career with games is the dream job for many, as many of us grew up with games. Because 
				of its sheer popularity, it is very easy to get into even as a kid. There are hundreds of free 
				resources online that range from block Java to full fledged Unity tutorials and free assets. 
				Additionally in game development, your job may have a great variety of tasks within it, similar

				available in the field and many have lax requirements, but in turn, jobs may be much less stable 
				as a project may run out of budget or fracture as a result of conflict. Additionally, it's been 
				reported that pay tends to be very low or is unstable when rushing to meet deadlines, and massive 
				overtime is also incredibly common.
